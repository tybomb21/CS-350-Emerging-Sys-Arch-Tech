# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech
Classwork and projects 
Project Summary:
The timers and interrupts project in CS-350 Emerging Systems Architecture and Technology aimed to explore and implement a robust system for managing timers and handling interrupts in a computer system. The project addressed the challenge of coordinating and prioritizing various time-sensitive tasks and events within a multitasking environment.

What I did particularly well:
During the project, I focused on understanding the underlying concepts of timers and interrupts thoroughly. I successfully designed and implemented an efficient system that effectively managed timers and handled interrupts. I paid attention to detail and ensured that the system met the project requirements and performed optimally.

Areas for Improvement:
Although I performed well overall, there are always areas for improvement. One aspect I could have improved upon is documenting the design and implementation process more comprehensively. Providing detailed documentation would have made it easier for others to understand and contribute to the project in the future.

Tools and Resources for Support Network:
Throughout the project, I utilized various tools and resources to enhance my understanding and support network. These included textbooks, online documentation, programming forums, and relevant research papers. Additionally, I actively engaged with classmates and instructors to exchange ideas and seek assistance when needed.

Transferable Skills:
This project provided me with valuable skills that can be applied to future projects and coursework. Some of the transferable skills include:

Systems Architecture: I gained a deeper understanding of how various components in a computer system interact and the importance of efficient coordination between them.
Problem Solving: I developed strong problem-solving skills by tackling challenges related to multitasking, prioritization, and synchronization of time-sensitive tasks.
Programming: I improved my programming skills, especially in low-level languages, as I worked on implementing the timers and interrupts system.
Documentation: I learned the importance of maintaining clear and concise documentation to aid in project understanding, maintenance, and future development.
Project Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:
To ensure the project's maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I followed best practices in software engineering. I structured the codebase logically, adhered to naming conventions, and provided comments to explain complex sections of code. I also employed modular design principles, allowing for easy modification or extension of functionality. By organizing the codebase and implementing appropriate abstractions, I made the project more maintainable, readable, and adaptable to future changes or enhancements.
